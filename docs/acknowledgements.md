## Acknowledgements

This publication is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort involving industry, academia, and government. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched the project by convening private- and public-sector organizations and individuals in 2013. Published in 2014 and revised during 2017 and 2018, this Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity has relied upon eight public workshops, multiple Requests for Comment or Information, and thousands of direct interactions with stakeholders from across all sectors of the United States along with many sectors from around the world.

The impetus to change Version 1.0 and the changes that appear in this Version 1.1 were based on:

* Feedback and frequently asked questions to NIST since release of Framework Version 1.0;
* [105 responses](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/rfi-framework-reducing-cyber-risks-critical-infrastructure) to the December 2015 request for information (RFI), [Views on the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/12/11/2015-31217/views-on-the-framework-for-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity);
* Over [85 comments](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/rfc-cybersecurity-framework-version-11-draft-2) on a December 5, 2017 proposed [second draft of Version 1.1](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2017/12/update-cybersecurity-framework);
* Over [120 comments](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/rfc-cybersecurity-framework-draft-version-11) on a January 10, 2017, proposed [first draft Version 1.1](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2017/01/nist-releases-update-cybersecurity-framework); and
* Input from over 1,200 attendees at the [2016](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2016/04/cybersecurity-framework-workshop-2016) and [2017](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/05/cybersecurity-framework-workshop-2017) Framework workshops.

In addition, NIST previously released Version 1.0 of the Cybersecurity Framework with a
companion document, NIST Roadmap for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. This
Roadmap highlighted key “areas of improvement” for further development, alignment, and
collaboration. Through private and public-sector efforts, some areas of improvement have
advanced enough to be included in this Framework Version 1.1.

NIST acknowledges and thanks all of those who have contributed to this Framework.
