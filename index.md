## Note to Readers on the Update
Version 1.1 of this Cybersecurity Framework refines, clarifies, and enhances Version 1.0, which was issued in February 2014. It incorporates comments received on the two drafts of Version 1.1.

Version 1.1 is intended to be implemented by first-time and current Framework users. Current users should be able to implement Version 1.1 with minimal or no disruption; compatibility with Version 1.0 has been an explicit objective.

The following table summarizes the changes made between Version 1.0 and Version 1.1.

      Clarified that terms like “compliance” can be confusing and mean something very different to various Framework stakeholders
    </td>
    <td colspan="6">
      Added clarity that the Framework has utility as a structure and language for organizing and expressing compliance with an organization’s own cybersecurity requirements. However, the variety of ways in which the Framework can be used by an organization means that phrases like “compliance with the Framework” can be confusing.

    <td colspan="4">
      An expanded Section 3.3 Communicating Cybersecurity Requirements with Stakeholders helps users better understand Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM), while a new Section 3.4 Buying Decisions highlights use of the Framework in understanding risk associated with commercial off-the-shelf products and services. Additional Cyber SCRM criteria were added to the Implementation Tiers. Finally, a Supply Chain Risk Management Category, including multiple Subcategories, has been added to the Framework Core.

    <td colspan="4">
      The language of the Access Control Category has been refined to better account for authentication, authorization, and identity proofing. This included adding one Subcategory each for Authentication and Identity Proofing.
